## Installation

Prior to use of this program, the user must have installed node.js and npm express.  They must have MongoDB and Mongoose loaded.  This application uses only the Command Line Interface, so the user will need to have enough experience to operate in that environment. In order see the operation of the application user will have an API testing tool (Insomnia, Postman) 

## Usage

This app does require some back-end knowledge, but it is easy to understand and operate.  The app will allow the user to open API routes in Insomnia (or Postman), and get a complete list of all thoughts from everyone on the network, or to fetch a single thought. The app also provides a "reaction" feature that allows users to provide a feedback.  The reaction con be removed

It allows typical CRUD operations, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and provides the associated schemas, routes, and information transfer using JSON format.  Operation of those routes and functions must be done in Insomnia (or Postman) to see that actual operation.


## Contributing

## Tests

Direct testing using the CLI and the Postman tool was used to monitor API responses to requests. API responses were check using Postman as my Insomnia will not work, even after uninstalling and reinstalling 2 times.
